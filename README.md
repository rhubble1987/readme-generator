  ## Description:  
  For this assignment, we were to build a command line app that would generate a professional README document. By using the inquirer npm, the user is prompted with questions for specific sections of the readme file. After completing these, the answers are then inserted into a templated markdown file containing the layout of the readme file.  

  ---  

  ## Installation:  
  To use this app, you must first have node.js installed on your machine. After that, download the readme-generator file. From there, install the inquirer npm in the readme-generator directory. After you've completed these steps, you're ready to start using the app.

  ## Usage:  
  To use the app, open the terminal and switch to the readme-generator directory. Then enter the command 'node index.js'. You will then be presented with the prompts for each section. Answer all of the questions and you'll then have your completed file. The newly created README can be found in the readme-generator folder.

  ## Licensing:  
  Public Domain - App can be shared and modified however you want!
